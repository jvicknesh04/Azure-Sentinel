name: Security groups enumerated via Graph API
version: 1.0.0
kind: Scheduled
description: |-
  This rule aims to detect the enumeration of security groups via the Graph API by looking for requests on the Groups endpoint with a specific filter on "securityEnabled eq true".

  Investigation steps
  -----------------------
  1. Scrutinize the user. Are they an IT profile?
  2. Look at the User Agent. If it is powershell, it is suspicious as this may be GraphRunner.
